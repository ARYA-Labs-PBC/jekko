# Agent Instructions

## Workspace Boundary

- Work only in the user-named active repo/worktree.
- Never switch to sibling clones, archives, backups, resolved symlink targets, `/tmp` worktrees, or duplicate roots.
- Never create repo copies or side folders outside the active repo; preserve work with git branches.
- Before edits, report `pwd`, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, and `git status --short --branch`.
- Use Jeryu APIs/CLI for local GitLab/MR work; no `glab`, credential scraping, or raw local GitLab API calls.

Read `agent/JANKURAI_STANDARD.md` first. For explicit phase or MASTER_PLAN work only, read `agent/MASTER_PLAN.md` before `tips/phases/00-phase-index.md`. Keep generated artifacts under their declared source commands.

Access contract: local agent workspaces use `~/.jeryu/access.toml`, `jeryu access doctor`, and `jeryu access repair --repo . --yes`; do not install/use `glab`, scrape credential stores, or keep HTTP local GitLab origins.
